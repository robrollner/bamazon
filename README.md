## Instructions for bamazon app

I created an app that stores items in a database and prompts a user to select and *purchase* those items. 

The user may also enter the manager program and check inventory levels, as well as add new inventory items or order more of what is currently available.

In the command line the user enters **node bamazonCustomer.js**, the app will display what is currently in stock and available to purchase.
